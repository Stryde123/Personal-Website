                <p class="bio">In these early stages of my professional career, I have been fortunate to gain work experience in a variety of fields through internships ranging from remote to in-person in both India and the United States. This journey has allowed me to develop teamwork skills and explore tracks such as Full Stack Development, Data Analysis, and Robotic Process Automation, while also picking up essential professional etiquette. These diverse experiences have provided me with platforms to thrive in different environments while also challenging my adaptability.</p>

                <h5>HASTUS Payroll Support Intern (June 2024-Present)</h5>
                <p><span class="image left"><img src="images/njt.png" alt="" /></span>New Jersey Transit has been one of the best learning experiences in my professional career so far. As an intern, I was tasked to assist in the smooth implementation of a 3rd party multi-million dollar payroll project for bus operations. This included creating reports, performing routine analysis, identifying trends and discrepancies. This internship often included creation of Python-based scripts for automated data formatting, analysis, and other planned tasks. As part of the internship, I also helped complete the creation of an e-Learning module to be implemented by NJ Transit to train potential bus operators in gaining their CDL license. I was also able to leverage the capabilities of Power Automate to further create automated solutions for the team. As a result of my performance, I was extended past my planned internship end date.</p>

                <p><span class="image left"><img src="images/fidelis.png" alt="" /></span>During my externship, I utilized Python libraries such as pandas and NumPy to perform complex data manipulations and transformations directly within Excel, facilitating efficient data cleaning and preparation. I also bucketed and categorized different subsets to evaluate customer trends and response behaviors through A/B testing using personalized marketing emails. Regularly collaborating with team members, I analyzed CRM data using Python, generating detailed findings and reports that were shared with advisors and Fidelis Animal Health executives.</p>

                <p><span class="image right"><img src="images/laesfera.png" alt="" /></span>La Esfera was my first break into the automation space as I was able to use my Java, Python and logical reasoning skills to create automated projects. I developed an Order Processing Bot that reduced processing time by 90% and significantly increased efficiency. Additionally, I created a bot using Selenium to extract stock values from Google Finance, with new data being stored in PostgreSQL. I also collaborated with a team to integrate mail automation and Excel automation into existing projects, enhancing overall functionality.

I created a demo frontend for a job search website from scratch using HTML, CSS, and Angular programming. Additionally, I collaborated in a group of eight on a backend query-based model, utilizing Java Applets, Postman, Jira, and Git. Following the successful completion of my internship, I received an offer to work on the frontend of a company project.
