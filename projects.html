                <p><span class="image left"><img src="images/gbr.png" alt="" /></span>In this project, as a team, we developed a College Tuition Predictor using advanced machine learning techniques, including Gradient Boosting Regressor (GBR), Neural Networks, and Decision Trees. The goal of this project was to create a predictive model that can accurately estimate the tuition fees of colleges based on various input features such as location, institution type, enrollment size, and other relevant factors. We utilized techniques like PCA, feature selection, feature enginerring, k-fold cross validations to effectively use the available data.</p>

                <p><span class="image left"><img src="images/nate.png" alt="" /></span>During the 24-hour MLH HackRU Spring 2023, my team and I developed an AI chatbot, which secured 2nd place in the NJ Transit category and was presented in front of NJ Transit personnel. I established database connectivity using Python to enhance the chatbot's functionality and utilized DialogFlow to structure the AI chatbot framework. The chatbot was trained with NJ Transit FAQs, making it an effective tool for providing transit-related information. <a href="https://devpost.com/software/nate-the-transit-mate">Meet Nate</a></p>

                <p><span class="image right"><img src="images/football.png" alt="" /></span>As a sports enthusiast, I developed a Team Rating Predictor using Python and Machine Learning. The project aimed to predict the ratings of football teams based on team's head to head records. This was made using concepts of posterior probablities and was a great experience as I learnt a lot about how different aspects of data can alter the results. The project was a great learning experience and allowed me to explore my passion for sports and data science.

                <p><span class="image right"><img src="images/adsorber.jpg" alt="" /></span>I designed a conceptual prototype to replace industry-scale carbon dioxide scrubbers using coconut-derived adsorbents. This innovative approach estimated an 80% reduction in maintenance costs compared to traditional methods. The project was featured in the VOLVO Breathefree 2019 eBook and recognized as a finalist in an Indian startup competition. This project also helped me gain more perspective in the real life expectations and implications for creating new products.</p>
